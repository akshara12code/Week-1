Crop-and-Fertilizer-recommendation-System

The Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System is a machine learning-based solution designed to assist farmers in making informed agricultural decisions. By analyzing soil and environmental parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, Temperature, Humidity, and Rainfall, the system predicts the best suitable crop and recommends the ideal fertilizer to optimize yield. Leveraging the Random Forest Algorithm, this project ensures accurate and reliable predictions. The system is built using datasets like crop_recommendation.csv and fertilizer.csv, focusing on enhancing farming efficiency and sustainability.
